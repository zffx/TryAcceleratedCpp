This template generates a whole family of functions, each of which takes two objects of 
the same type and calls f  with the greater of the two objects. There's no need to 
parenthesize parameters inside the function body, no need to worry about evaluating 
parameters multiple times, etc. Furthermore, because callWithMax  is a real function, it 
obeys scope and access rules. For example, it makes perfect sense to talk about an 
inline functio n that is private to a class. In general, there's just no way to do that with a 
macro.
